#Define a list of items in array and create a for-loop that iterates through the array
#string array
my_list = ["chips","snacks","soda","pretzels","candy"]
#|chips is 1, snacks is 2, soda is 3, pretzels is 4, candy is 5|

#Loop through the list using a for-loop
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
#it's going to loop throught every iteration than print it out
